            A lot of us have been wondering what we can do to help out in these situation since we can't donate and probably can't go out to protest. Well a good start is signing petitions. There are a bunch of websites that host petitions for these causes but, the most popular right now is Change. They host most, if not all, of the petitions regarding police brutality, police reform, and justice for those who have been killed. Go to the Change website and you will see a bunch of petitons. You may have already seen some petitions circulating around your social medias. You should sign any you find aligin with your values and that you are willing to sign. You should also share the petitons so others can sign and share them as well. If you are skeptical of petitons and if they actually work. You should know that the petition for George Floyd, that has 19 million signatures, helped push for the arrest of the officers that killed him. So go sign some petitons and make a difference.
